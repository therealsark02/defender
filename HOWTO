  UP         D      FIRE       L
  DOWN       C      SMART BOMB S
  THRUST     M      REVERSE    SPACE
  HYPERSPACE F 

Joystick and Joypad (Jagpad compatible) controllers may be used, if
configured via the setup (F4) menu.


II. PLAYING DEFENDER
====================

DEFENDER
--------
The aim of the game is to defend the ASTRONAUTS on the planet surface.

LANDERs will try to pick them up, and if a LANDER gets to the top of
the screen with an ASTRONAUT, the LANDER will transform into a MUTANT
and aggressively attack you.

If you kill a LANDER carrying an ASTRONAUT, the ASTRONAUT will fall.
An ASTRONAUT can survive a short fall, but will die from a high fall. You
can catch an ASTRONAUT as it falls, and place them safely back on
the ground.

If all ASTRONAUTS are lost, the planet explodes and all LANDERs transform
into MUTANTS and attack you.

BOMBers plant MINES as they fly by, but do not shoot. Avoid the MINES!

PODs are benign until shot, at which point they burst a flock of SWARMERs,
which will attack you.

Work quickly to kill all the aliens, as if you take too long, UFOs will
spawn and attack.

SHIP CONTROLS
-------------
The arcade controls for your ship are UP and DOWN, THRUST to move forward,
and REVERSE to change direction.

With a joystick or joypad, LEFT and RIGHT are used instead of THRUST
and REVERSE, and your ship will turn to face the direction you move
the joystick.

If you find yourself overwhelmed and need to escape, you can use the
HYPERSPACE key, which will transport you away to another part of the
planet. HYPERSPACE is dangerous, and there is a chance that your ship
will explode when you use it. It is a last resort!

OFFENSE
-------
Your primary weapon is your LASER, fired using the FIRE control. The
LASER will take care of an enemy in your ship's line-of-sight.

A limited number of SMART BOMBs are provided, which will destroy all
enemies on the screen. Use them wisely.

SCORING AND BONUSES
-------------------
Point are scored for killing enemies, and 250 or 500 point bonuses are
awarded for saving captured ASTRONAUTS.

Every 10,000 points you earn a new ship and a new SMART BOMB.

HIGH SCORES
-----------
Two high score tables are maintained:
  "Today's Greatest" shows the best scores since the program was loaded.

  "All Time Greatest" shows the best scores recorded on the game disk.

If a new high score is good enough to make it onto the All Time list,
then the new high score table may be saved to the game disk. This can
be done via the SETUP menus, or, if configured, automatically as soon
as the high-score is entered.
